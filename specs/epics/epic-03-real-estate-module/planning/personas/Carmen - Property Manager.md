## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

   - Legal documents and fair housing rules in formal English
   - Fast-paced HOA meetings with native English speakers
   - Worried about misunderstanding important details
   - Accent sometimes creates communication barriers with vendors

2. **Tenant Communication**

3. **Compliance & Liability**
   - Fair Housing complaints require exact records of conversations
   - Maintenance requests must be documented (liability if injury occurs)

4. **Cultural Challenges**
   - Some tenants distrust "official" recording (immigration fears)

### Technology Pain Points
- Uses phone recorder for important calls (audio only, hard to review)

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Her Own Words

> "I understand English very well, but when landlords start talking about 'cap rates' and 'cash-on-cash returns,' I smile and nod. Then I go home and Google everything. A transcript would help me learn this language."

> "Tenants call at 11 PM about a broken AC. I'm half-asleep, trying to write notes. The next day I can't read my handwriting. Then they say 'I already told you about this' and I have no proof."

> "I manage properties in immigrant communities. Many tenants are scared of 'recording' - they think it's ICE or government. I need something discrete, private, that stays on MY phone."

> "My maintenance guys speak Spanish. I attend English HOA meetings. I spend 2-3 hours every week translating notes from English to Spanish. It's exhausting."

> "Fair Housing complaints are serious. If a tenant says I discriminated, I need exact records of what I said. One mistake could cost me my business."
