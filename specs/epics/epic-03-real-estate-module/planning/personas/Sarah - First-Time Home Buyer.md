**Status**: Single, first-time home buyer

## 🎯 Goals & Motivations

### Home Buying Goals
- **Find the perfect first home** - 2-bedroom condo or small house in East Austin
- **Make a confident decision** - First major purchase, wants to avoid buyer's remorse
- **Stay within budget** - Pre-approved for $350K, wants to keep monthly payment under $2,500
- **Close within 3 months** - Current lease ends in 90 days, needs to time move

### Personal Goals
- Build equity instead of renting ($1,800/month rent feels wasted)
- Find a home that supports her lifestyle (walkable to coffee shops, dog-friendly)
- Make smart investment (tech job could relocate, wants resale value)
- Prove to herself she can handle homeownership (confidence building)

### Why She Needs Transcript Parser
- **Property confusion** - After seeing 18 properties, can't remember which had which features
- **Decision paralysis** - Overwhelming amount of information from Lisa, inspectors, mortgage broker
- **Partner misalignment** - Best friend (co-decision maker) can't attend all showings, needs to share details
- **Detail tracking** - Lisa mentions important things ("HOA covers roof," "seller might negotiate") but Sarah forgets
- **Comparison struggles** - Needs to compare properties side-by-side but notes are incomplete
- **Question tracking** - Thinks of questions after showings, can't remember if they were answered

## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Home Search Challenges
1. **Property Overload**
   - Viewed 18 properties in 2 months (some twice)
   - Properties blur together: "Wait, which one had the updated kitchen?"
   - Confused about which features belong to which house
   - Can't remember Lisa's specific comments about each property

2. **Note-Taking Struggles**
   - Takes photos but forgets context ("Why did I take a photo of this closet?")
   - Scribbles notes on phone while touring (awkward, misses what Lisa is saying)
   - Notes are fragmented: "granite counters" - but which house?
   - Friend asks questions she can't answer: "Did the $320K one have covered parking?"

3. **Information Overwhelm**
   - Lisa shares critical details verbally: market trends, neighborhood insights, negotiation strategies
   - Inspector explains issues during walkthrough (electrical panel, roof condition) - forgets 70% by evening
   - Mortgage broker discusses rates and terms (confusing jargon) - can't recall specifics later
   - HOA rules, utility costs, property tax estimates - all verbal, all forgotten

4. **Decision-Making Anxiety**
   - Biggest purchase of her life, terrified of making wrong choice
   - Compares properties from memory (unreliable)
   - Partner (best friend Sarah consults) wasn't at 12 of the 18 showings - hard to share context
   - Needs to re-visit properties multiple times because forgot details

5. **Communication Gaps**
   - Lisa mentions "seller is motivated" or "comparable sold for $15K more" - Sarah forgets specifics
   - Questions arise days later: "Did Lisa say the AC was new or just serviced?"
   - Can't remember if specific concerns (like noise from highway) were addressed
   - Misses subtle cues from Lisa about property value or issues

### Technology Pain Points
- Uses iPhone Notes app (disorganized, hard to search)
- Takes 200+ photos across properties (no organization, context lost)
- Tries to record Lisa with voice memos (feels rude, rarely reviews 45-min files)
- Pinterest board for "dream home features" doesn't connect to actual properties seen
- Spreadsheet with property addresses (no detail, just prices and bed/bath counts)

---

## 💻 Technical Profile

### Devices & Tools
- **Primary Device**: iPhone 13 (takes photos, notes, searches Zillow)
- **Secondary**: MacBook Air (spreadsheet, mortgage calculators, neighborhood research)
- **Current Tools**:
  - Zillow app (property search, saved homes)
  - iPhone Notes (messy property notes)
  - iPhone Photos (200+ property photos, unorganized)
  - Google Maps (neighborhood exploration, commute times)
  - Pinterest (inspiration, not tied to actual search)
  - Spreadsheet (basic property comparison - address, price, bed/bath)

### Tech Proficiency
- **Comfort Level**: High (works in tech, comfortable with apps)
- **Learning Style**: Self-taught, prefers intuitive interfaces
- **Adoption**: Quickly adopts apps that solve immediate problems
- **Mobile**: 100% mobile during showings, uses laptop for deep research at home

## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Property Showing Workflow (Current State - Without Transcript Parser)
1. **Before Showing**: Reviews Zillow listing, creates mental checklist of questions
2. **During Showing** (awkward multitasking):
   - Takes 15-20 photos per property
   - Tries to listen to Lisa while typing notes on phone
   - Misses half of Lisa's insights while photographing
   - Feels rude recording with voice memos, rarely does it
3. **After Showing** (in car, rushed):
   - Adds property to spreadsheet (basic info only)
   - Types fragmented notes: "nice kitchen, small backyard, Lisa said something about roof?"
   - Forgets 60% of conversation by the time she gets home
4. **That Evening** (decision-making):
   - Looks at photos, can't remember context
   - Texts Lisa with questions she forgot to ask
   - Friend asks "What did Lisa think?" - Sarah can't remember exactly
   - Spends 2 hours trying to reconstruct the showing from photos and memory

### Property Showing Workflow (Ideal - With Transcript Parser)
1. **Before Showing**: Lisa shares Transcript Parser link, Sarah opens app
2. **During Showing** (fully present):
   - Taps "Start Recording" on phone (Lisa consented)
   - Focuses entirely on Lisa and property, no note-taking
   - Asks all questions naturally, knows everything is captured
   - Takes photos without needing to annotate context
3. **After Showing** (in car, 5 minutes):
   - Reviews AI summary: "3-bed, 2-bath, $315K, Lisa noted: excellent school district, seller motivated, roof is 8 years old, HOA $150/month"
   - Tags property: "Top 3" and "Great location"
   - Shares transcript link with friend for feedback
4. **That Evening** (confident decision-making):
   - Searches all transcripts for "HOA fees" - instant results across all 18 properties
   - Compares Lisa's comments side-by-side: "This is the best value I've seen" vs. "Overpriced for this neighborhood"
   - Reviews inspector's transcript about electrical panel concerns (remembered clearly)
   - Shares key excerpts with friend via text

### Specific Scenarios
- **Multiple showings in one day**: Keeps properties distinct by recording each separately with property address tags
- **Inspection walkthrough**: Records inspector's findings, searches transcript later for "foundation" or "plumbing"
- **Mortgage consultation**: Records loan officer's rate comparison, refers back when making offer decisions
- **Follow-up questions**: Searches Lisa's transcripts to verify what was said before texting new questions
- **Sharing with friend/partner**: Sends transcript excerpts instead of trying to summarize

## 📊 Success Metrics

### How Sarah Measures Success
- **Confidence in decision**: Feels certain she's making informed choice, not forgetting critical details
- **Time saved**: No more 2-hour evening sessions trying to remember showings
- **Better questions**: Asks informed follow-up questions based on reviewing transcripts
- **Less stress**: Reduces decision anxiety from "I can't remember" to "I have all the details"
- **Friend involvement**: Friend can review transcripts and give meaningful input without attending showings

### What Would Make Her a Power User
- **Property tagging**: "Top 3," "Pass," "Reconsider" - organize properties
- **Search across all properties**: "granite counters" finds all homes with that feature
- **Comparison view**: Side-by-side transcripts of Lisa's comments on top 3 properties
- **Share excerpts**: Send specific snippets to friend ("Listen to what Lisa said about resale value")
- **Integration with photos**: Tap photo, see what Lisa was saying at that moment
- **Question tracking**: "Did I ask about HOA pet policy?" - search for it

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Her Own Words

> "I've seen so many houses, they're all blending together. I can't remember if the one with the nice kitchen had the good school district or the sketchy alley access."

> "Lisa tells me really important things - like 'the seller is divorcing, they're motivated' - but I forget the exact words. I want to be able to look back at exactly what she said."

> "I take a million photos but I have no idea what I was thinking. Like, why did I photograph this weird closet? Was it good or bad?"

> "My best friend is helping me decide, but she can't come to all the showings. I try to FaceTime her but the connection is bad. If I could just send her a transcript of what Lisa said, she'd actually be able to help."

> "The inspector spent 2 hours explaining problems with the house, and I understood maybe 40% of it. I wish I could re-read what he said about the foundation issue."

> "I'm spending $330,000 and making decisions based on my terrible memory. That's insane. I need a better system."

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **Dead-simple interface** - Sarah is stressed, needs one-tap recording
- **Mobile-only workflow** - Never at a desktop during showings
- **Property organization** - Must tag/categorize properties easily
- **Search-first** - Needs to find specific details across all properties
- **Sharing-friendly** - Needs to share with friend, family, maybe co-buyer
- **Visual connection** - Link transcripts to photos taken at same time

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **One-tap recording with property tag** - "123 Oak St" automatically in transcript
2. **Search across all properties** - Find "updated kitchen" in all 18 transcripts
3. **AI summary per property** - 5-bullet-point summary of Lisa's key points
4. **Share transcript links** - Send to friend for feedback
5. **Comparison view** - Side-by-side transcripts of top 3 properties
6. **Tag/categorize** - "Top 3," "Pass," "Reconsider," "Need Second Showing"
7. **Highlight key quotes** - Pin Lisa's most important comments

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- Complex setup before each showing (needs instant start)
- Requiring Sarah to manually transcribe or edit (defeats the purpose)
- Desktop-only features (100% mobile workflow)
- Privacy concerns (needs clear consent from Lisa, inspector, etc.)
- Expensive premium features (on a tight budget)
- Technical jargon (she's not a real estate professional)
