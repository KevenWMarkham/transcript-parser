## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

### ADHD-Specific Challenges
1. **Working Memory Deficits**
   - Forgets contractor quotes 5 minutes after conversation
   - Loses track of verbal change orders and commitments
   - Can't remember which property had which issue
   - Struggles to recall inspection details when creating scope of work

2. **Executive Function Difficulties**
   - Loses handwritten notes constantly
   - Forgets to follow up on contractor commitments
   - Overwhelmed by too many simultaneous project details
   - Procrastinates on documentation (boring, exhausting for ADHD brain)

3. **Multitasking Impossibility**
   - Cannot take notes while listening (brain can't handle dual-task)
   - Misses important details when trying to write and listen
   - Conversation quality suffers when attempting to document
   - Loses train of thought easily during discussions

4. **Organization Challenges**
   - No systematic way to organize property information
   - Hard to compare contractor bids from weeks ago
   - Loses track of what was discussed with which contractor
   - Multiple projects blur together in memory

### Business Impact
- **Costly mistakes**: Forgot contractor quoted $8K for plumbing, not $6K - lost $2K
- **Missed commitments**: Contractor said he'd include drywall, Michael forgot, dispute ensued
- **Poor bids**: Can't remember inspection details, underestimates rehab costs
- **Relationship strain**: Contractors frustrated by "did you say X or Y?" questions
- **Opportunity cost**: Spends 10 hrs/week trying to reconstruct conversations

### Technology Pain Points
- Handwritten notes lost or illegible
- Voice recorder audio too long to review (ADHD = hard to stay focused)
- No organization system for recordings
- Camera photos of properties lack context (what was the issue here?)
- Cannot find specific information quickly (ADHD = poor archival memory)

### Devices & Tools
- **Primary Device**: iPhone 14 (records everything, compensates for memory)

  - Calculator (quick ROI estimates)

## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Weekly Property Investment Workflow

   - **ADHD benefit**: No multitasking, full focus on observing property

2. **Contractor Bids** (3-5 per project):

   - Notes progress, issues, change orders
   - Searches transcript history: "did we agree to upgrade tile?"
   - Creates punch list from verbal walkthrough

4. **Investor Meetings** (fundraising):

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In His Own Words

> "I can walk through a property and see everything that needs to be fixed. But 20 minutes later, I'll forget half of it. ADHD working memory is terrible."

> "Contractors think I'm flaky when I ask 'did you say $6K or $8K?' three times. I'm not flaky - my brain just doesn't hold numbers. If I could record and search later, I'd look way more professional."

> "I've tried taking notes during contractor walkthroughs. I either miss what they're saying, or I lose the notes. Usually both."

> "I have 800 voice memos on my phone. I've listened to maybe 50 of them. ADHD brain cannot sit through 15 minutes of audio to find one 30-second piece of information."

> "Nobody in construction knows I have ADHD. There's stigma - they'll think I'm unreliable. But if I had a system that recorded everything locally, on my phone, I could look normal and competent."

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **ADHD-optimized design**:
  - Short summaries (not long transcripts)
  - Visual organization (color-coding, icons)
  - Instant search (no drilling through menus)
  - Minimal distractions (clean, simple UI)
  - One-tap actions (no multi-step workflows)

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Hands-free recording (Meta Ray-Ban)** - Eliminates multitasking burden
2. **AI summaries** - 1-minute read instead of 15-min audio review
3. **Search across all projects** - Instant answers to "what did contractor say?"
4. **Auto-tagging by property** - No manual organization required
5. **Contractor bid comparison** - Side-by-side view of quotes
6. **Visual + audio** - Photos linked to transcript (context for ADHD memory)
7. **Local processing (Ollama)** - Privacy about disability
8. **Reminders/follow-ups** - Extract action items automatically

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- **Long text walls** - ADHD brain cannot process
- **Manual organization** - Executive function challenges make this impossible
- **Multi-step workflows** - Too many clicks = abandonment
- **Complex setup** - Must work immediately (no patience for setup)
- **Requiring note-taking** - Defeats the purpose
- **Cloud-only** - Privacy concerns about disability disclosure
