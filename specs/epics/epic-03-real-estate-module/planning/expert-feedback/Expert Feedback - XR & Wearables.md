## 📋 Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - XR glasses are PERFECT for real estate professionals

The emergence of consumer XR glasses (Meta Ray-Ban, Apple Vision Pro, XREAL, Vuzix) represents a **paradigm shift** for real estate documentation. These devices offer:
- **Hands-free recording** (no phone/clipboard during client interactions)
- **First-person POV** (captures exactly what agent sees: property details, client reactions)
- **Spatial audio** (better speaker separation, know which room comment was made in)
- **Always-available** (wear daily, record any showing spontaneously)
- **Professional appearance** (more discrete than holding up phone)

**Real Estate Module MUST support XR glasses** or risk becoming obsolete as these devices achieve mainstream adoption in professional services (est. 2025-2027).

## 🎯 Why XR Glasses Matter for Real Estate Professionals

### Problem with Current Recording Methods

**Phone/Tablet Recording**:
- ❌ Must hold device or prop it up (not hands-free)
- ❌ Limited field of view (misses details if camera moves)
- ❌ Obvious (clients feel "recorded" - uncomfortable)
- ❌ Can't take notes simultaneously (hands occupied)
- ❌ Unprofessional (looking at phone instead of client)
- ❌ Poor spatial audio (mono or basic stereo)

**Clipboard/Notepad**:
- ❌ Breaks eye contact with client (Lisa loses rapport)
- ❌ Can't write fast enough (misses details)
- ❌ Unprofessional during luxury showings
- ❌ Writing while walking = safety hazard

**Voice Recorder**:
- ❌ Audio only (misses visual property details)
- ❌ Poor speaker separation (hard to tell who said what)
- ❌ No spatial context (which room was comment in?)

---

### XR Glasses Solve These Problems

**Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses** (as example):
- ✅ **Hands-free**: Tap temple to record, both hands free for gestures
- ✅ **First-person POV**: Captures exactly what agent sees (property features, client reactions)
- ✅ **Discrete**: Looks like regular designer glasses (Ray-Ban Wayfarer)
- ✅ **Spatial audio**: 5-mic array knows which room comment was made in
- ✅ **Always available**: Wear all day, spontaneous recording
- ✅ **Visual + audio**: Captures property details AND conversation
- ✅ **Long battery**: 4+ hours (full showing day)
- ✅ **Professional**: No visible phone, maintains client eye contact

## 🏡 Real Estate-Specific XR Use Cases

### Lisa (Residential Agent) + Ray-Ban Meta

**Morning Property Showings** (3 homes, 2-hour tour):
1. Arrives at first property, taps glasses to start recording
2. Walks through home with clients Sarah & Tom
3. Glasses capture:
   - Lisa's verbal observations: "Notice the crown molding, original hardwood"
   - Client reactions: "Wow, I love this natural light!" (living room)
   - Sarah's concern: "This kitchen feels dated" (kitchen)
   - Tom's question: "How old is the roof?" (exterior)
4. Glasses know spatial location (living room vs kitchen via audio cues)
5. After showing, Lisa reviews transcript in car (5 minutes)
6. AI summary: "Loved: natural light, hardwood floors. Concerns: dated kitchen, roof age"
7. Lisa sends personalized follow-up email (generated from transcript) 30 min later

**Value**:
- No clipboard/phone = professional appearance, better rapport
- Captures every detail = no forgotten client preferences
- Spatial audio = knows which room had which comment
- Fast follow-up = competitive advantage over agents who write notes later

**ROI**: 7 additional deals/year (from better client service) = $70K additional income
**Cost**: $379 for glasses (0.5% of additional revenue)

---

### David (Commercial Broker) + Apple Vision Pro

**Warehouse Tour with Institutional Client** (90-minute walkthrough):
1. Wears Vision Pro for 200,000 sq ft warehouse tour
2. Client (REIT acquisitions team) has 30+ requirements
3. Vision Pro captures:
   - Spatial video (3D visualization of space for client review later)
   - 6-mic spatial audio (knows who said what, where in building)
   - OCR of signage: "Clear height: 32 feet" (automatically extracted)
   - Client requirements: "We need 40-foot clear height minimum" (spatial location: loading dock area)
   - Objection: "Ceiling is too low here" (knows exact location in building)
4. After tour, David reviews:
   - Transcript with spatial markers (which part of building had which comment)
   - Visual content extracted (clear height specs, loading dock count)
   - Client requirement checklist (auto-generated from conversation)
5. Creates investment memo (AI-assisted, 2 hours instead of 6)

**Value**:
- Hands-free during $15M+ client tour = professional, attentive
- Spatial context = knows which requirements apply to which part of building
- OCR property specs = no manual measurement recording
- Visual 3D record = send to client for remote review (decision-makers who couldn't attend)
- Accurate requirements = no $50K+ mistakes in deal structuring

**ROI**: 1 saved mistake ($50K+) + 4 hrs saved per deal × 10 deals/year = $100K+ value
**Cost**: $3,499 for Vision Pro (3.5% of value created)

---

### Carmen (Property Manager) + Ray-Ban Meta (Discrete)

**Tenant Apartment Inspection** (30 minutes per unit):
1. Wears Ray-Ban glasses (looks professional, non-threatening)
2. Walks apartment with tenant present
3. Glasses capture:
   - Carmen's verbal notes: "Smoke detector missing in bedroom"
   - Tenant complaint: "The AC hasn't worked right for 2 weeks" (timestamp, location)
   - Maintenance issues: "Water stain on ceiling, possible leak"
4. No clipboard = both hands free to test faucets, check windows
5. Tenant comfortable (doesn't feel "officially recorded" - privacy-sensitive community)
6. After inspection, Carmen generates report (5 min instead of 30 min)
7. Sends work orders to maintenance crew in Spanish (AI translation from English transcript)

**Value**:
- Discrete recording = tenant trust (important in immigrant communities)
- Hands-free = thorough inspection (can test appliances, take photos)
- Accurate documentation = liability protection (Fair Housing compliance)
- Bilingual workflow = Spanish work orders for crew (saves 3 hrs/week translation)

**ROI**: 5 hrs/week saved (documentation + translation) = 260 hrs/year = $10K+ value
**Cost**: $299 for glasses (3% of value created)

---

### Michael (Investor with ADHD) + Ray-Ban Meta

**Property Walkthrough for Potential Flip** (45 minutes):
1. Wears glasses for hands-free recording (ADHD = can't multitask note-taking)
2. Walks property, verbally notes issues:
   - "Kitchen needs full gut, estimate $25K"
   - "Foundation crack here, need structural engineer"
   - "Roof looks 5-10 years old, budget $15K replacement"
   - "Electrical panel only 100 amp, upgrade to 200 amp"
3. ADHD benefit: Full focus on observing property (no divided attention writing notes)
4. After tour, reviews AI summary (can't focus on full transcript - ADHD)
5. Summary: "Rehab estimate: $85K (kitchen, roof, electrical, foundation)"
6. Compares to mental budget, adjusts offer price

**Later - Contractor Walkthrough** (60 minutes):
1. Records contractor's verbal quote hands-free
2. Contractor: "I'll do kitchen demo, drywall, tile, paint for $18K, 4 weeks"
3. Michael's ADHD = forgets numbers instantly
4. Transcript preserves exact quote (perfect memory even when working memory fails)
5. Compares 3 contractor transcripts side-by-side
6. Chooses best bid based on exact scope stated

**Value**:
- Hands-free = works WITH ADHD (no multitasking)
- Perfect transcription = compensates for working memory deficits
- Searchable history = finds "what did contractor say about plumbing?" instantly
- Prevents $5K+ mistakes from forgotten verbal commitments

**ROI**: 2-3 saved mistakes per year ($10K+) + reduced stress = priceless for ADHD brain
**Cost**: $299 for glasses (3% of saved costs)

## 🔧 Technical Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic XR Support (Sprint 03 or Post-Launch)

**Supported Devices** (prioritize by real estate adoption):
1. Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses (most affordable, widest adoption)
2. Apple Vision Pro (high-end commercial, luxury agents)
3. Vuzix Shield (property inspectors, investors)

**Integration Approach**:

#### Option A: Cloud Upload (Easiest - MVP)
```
XR Glasses → Meta/Apple Cloud → Transcript Parser API → IndexedDB

Flow:
1. Agent records showing on Ray-Ban glasses
2. Video/audio uploads to Meta cloud (automatic via Meta app)
3. Meta app on phone has "Share to Transcript Parser" option
4. Transcript Parser API downloads from Meta cloud
5. Processes (transcription, AI features)
6. Stores locally in IndexedDB (offline-capable after initial sync)
```

**Pros**:
- No custom hardware integration needed
- Uses existing cloud infrastructure (Meta, Apple)
- Simple user flow (agent already using Meta app)

**Cons**:
- Privacy concern (data goes through Meta/Apple) - David won't use this
- Depends on third-party APIs (may break)
- Storage limits on glasses (32GB = ~8 hours video)

**Best for**: Lisa, Carmen, Michael (residential/property management - less NDA concerns)

---

#### Option B: Direct Device Integration (Better Privacy - Future)
```
XR Glasses → Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct → Phone App → Transcript Parser → IndexedDB

Flow:
1. Agent wears glasses, starts recording
2. Glasses stream video/audio to phone app (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct)
3. Transcript Parser mobile app receives stream
4. Real-time transcription (or buffer for later processing)
5. Stores locally (no cloud intermediary)
```

**Pros**:
- Privacy-first (no cloud upload) - David can use for NDA-compliant recordings
- Faster (no cloud round-trip)
- Works offline (airplane mode, poor cell signal)

**Cons**:
- Requires custom mobile app development (8-12 story points)
- Bluetooth bandwidth limits (compressed video)
- Battery drain on phone (receiving stream)

**Best for**: David (commercial broker with NDAs), privacy-conscious agents

---

#### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
```
Default: Cloud upload (easy onboarding - 80% of users)
Advanced: Direct connection (privacy, power users - 20% of users)
Enterprise: Brokerage-hosted server (CBRE, Keller Williams)
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Settings page
interface XRGlassesSettings {
  connectedDevice?: {
    type: 'meta_rayban' | 'apple_vision_pro' | 'vuzix_shield';
    name: string;
    serialNumber: string;
    connectionMethod: 'cloud' | 'direct' | 'enterprise_server';
  };

  uploadPreference: 'auto' | 'wifi_only' | 'manual';

  cloudIntegration: {
    metaConnected: boolean;
    appleConnected: boolean;
    autoImport: boolean; // Auto-import from Meta/Apple cloud
  };

  directConnection: {
    enabled: boolean;
    protocol: 'bluetooth' | 'wifi_direct';
    encryption: boolean;
  };

  privacySettings: {
    clientConsentRequired: boolean; // State law compliance
    autoBlurFaces: boolean; // Privacy protection
    audioOnlyMode: boolean; // For privacy-sensitive showings
    localProcessingOnly: boolean; // David's NDA compliance
  };
}

// User flow
async function importFromXRGlasses() {
  // Step 1: Detect connected glasses
  const device = await detectXRDevice();

  if (!device) {
    return showError('No XR glasses detected. Connect via Meta/Apple app first.');
  }

  // Step 2: Choose import method based on user tier & privacy needs
  const method = await determineImportMethod(device, user);

  // Step 3: Import based on method
  if (method === 'cloud') {
    await importFromCloud(device); // Lisa, Carmen, Michael
  } else if (method === 'direct') {
    await importViaDirect(device); // David (NDA compliance)
  } else {
    await importFromEnterpriseServer(device); // CBRE corporate server
  }

  // Step 4: Process recording
  await processPropertyRecording();
}
```

### Phase 2: Advanced XR Features (Future - 2026+)

#### Feature 1: Real-Time AR Transcription Overlay
**What**: Show live transcript in AR glasses during property showing

**Use Case** (Carmen - Bilingual Property Manager):
- Landlord speaks fast English (financial jargon: cap rates, NOI, cash-on-cash return)
- Carmen's AR glasses display live captions in her field of view
- She can read + listen simultaneously (multi-modal comprehension)
- After meeting, reviews transcript to understand complex terms
- Uses transcript to create Spanish summary for maintenance staff

**Technical Stack**:
```
XR Glasses (Mic) → Phone (Whisper.cpp) → AR Display (Glasses)

1. Glasses capture audio, stream to phone via Bluetooth
2. Phone runs Whisper.cpp (local AI transcription)
3. Phone sends caption text back to glasses AR display
4. Glasses overlay captions at bottom of vision
5. Low latency: < 500ms (acceptable for real-time)
```

**Challenges**:
- Current Ray-Ban Gen 2 don't have AR displays (audio/camera only)
- Need Meta Orion (2025-2026) or Vision Pro (expensive)
- Battery drain (continuous AI processing)

**Timeline**: 2026+ (when AR display glasses mainstream)

---

#### Feature 2: Spatial Audio Transcription
**What**: Use spatial audio to know which room comment was made in

**Use Case** (Lisa - Multiple Room Showings):
- Client touring 4-bedroom home (8 rooms total)
- Spatial audio detects location based on room acoustics + audio cues
- Transcript tagged by room:
  - `[Living Room]` "I love this natural light!" - Sarah
  - `[Kitchen]` "This feels dated, we'd need to update" - Tom
  - `[Master Bedroom]` "Great closet space!" - Sarah
  - `[Backyard]` "Perfect for the kids" - Tom
- Lisa reviews transcript, knows which room had which comment
- Follow-up email references specific rooms: "I saw you loved the master bedroom closet!"

**Technical**:
```typescript
interface SpatialPropertyTranscript {
  property: {
    address: string;
    rooms: Array<{
      id: string;
      name: string; // "Living Room", "Kitchen", "Master Bedroom"
      audioSignature: number[]; // Spatial audio fingerprint
    }>;
  };

  entries: Array<{
    speaker_id: string;
    speaker_name?: string; // "Sarah", "Tom", "Agent Lisa"
    room_id: string; // Which room was this said in?
    room_confidence: number; // 0-1
    text: string;
    timestamp: number;
    spatialPosition?: { azimuth: number; elevation: number };
  }>;
}

// AI prompt for spatial room detection
const prompt = `
You are processing a spatial audio recording from a property showing.

Audio cues detected:
- 00:05:00 - 00:12:00: Large room acoustics, echo (likely living room)
- 00:12:00 - 00:18:00: Smaller room, tile echo (likely kitchen/bathroom)
- 00:18:00 - 00:25:00: Carpeted room, soft acoustics (likely bedroom)

Transcript with spatial tags:
[Living Room, 00:05:30] Sarah: "I love this natural light!"
[Living Room, 00:07:15] Tom: "Yeah, this is great for entertaining"
[Kitchen, 00:12:45] Sarah: "This kitchen feels dated"
[Master Bedroom, 00:19:30] Sarah: "Great closet space!"
`;
```

**Supported Devices**:
- Apple Vision Pro (6-mic array, best spatial audio)
- Meta Ray-Ban (5-mic array, good)
- Vuzix Shield (4-mic array, decent)

**Timeline**: Sprint 03 or post-launch (depends on device adoption)

---

#### Feature 3: Visual Content Extraction (OCR)
**What**: Extract text from property details, inspection reports, contractor bids

**Use Case** (Michael - Investor Property Walkthrough):
- Walks property wearing glasses
- Glasses capture visual content:
  - Property tax bill on table: "$4,200/year" (OCR extracted)
  - Contractor bid sheet: "Roof replacement: $15,000" (OCR extracted)
  - Inspection report summary: "Foundation crack, recommend structural engineer" (OCR extracted)
- After tour, transcript includes:
  - `[OCR, 00:15:30]` Property Tax: $4,200/year
  - `[OCR, 00:23:15]` Contractor Bid - Roof: $15,000
  - `[OCR, 00:31:45]` Inspection: Foundation crack noted
- Michael doesn't need to manually copy numbers (ADHD benefit - no multitasking)

**Technical Stack**:
```
Video Recording → Frame Extraction → OCR (Tesseract) → Property Data Extraction

1. Extract frames when text detected (document, sign, report)
2. Run OCR on frames (detect text, tables, forms)
3. For financial data: Validate against typical ranges
4. Insert into transcript at timestamp: "[00:15:30] [OCR]: Property Tax $4,200/year"
```

**Example Output**:
```markdown
## Property Walkthrough: 123 Oak Street

[00:00:00] Michael: "Walking through the kitchen now"

[00:05:15] **[OCR - Property Tax Bill]**
- Annual Property Tax: $4,200
- Assessed Value: $320,000
- Last Paid: 2024-01-15

[00:12:30] Michael: "Contractor left a bid for roof work"

[00:12:45] **[OCR - Contractor Bid]**
- Roof Replacement: $15,000
- Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Warranty: 10 years

[00:18:00] Michael: "Looking at the inspection report"

[00:18:20] **[OCR - Inspection Report Summary]**
- Foundation: Crack detected in southeast corner
- Recommendation: Consult structural engineer
- Estimated Cost: $5,000 - $10,000
```

**Challenges**:
- OCR accuracy on handwritten text (70-80%)
- Processing time (video is large, OCR is slow)
- Privacy (if documents have personal info)

**Timeline**: Post-launch (nice-to-have, not critical)

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics for Real Estate XR Recording

### Challenge: Recording Laws & Client Consent

**Issues**:
1. **State recording laws**:
   - Two-party consent states (California, Florida, etc.) - BOTH parties must consent
   - One-party consent states (Texas, New York, etc.) - Only one party needs to consent
   - Real estate agents must comply with state law

2. **Client privacy**:
   - Recording client financial info (pre-approval amount, down payment)
   - Personal details (family situation, employment, health)
   - Property concerns (divorce, foreclosure, urgent sale)

3. **Fair Housing compliance**:
   - Recording protects against Fair Housing complaints
   - But must not capture protected class information (race, religion, family status)
   - Accurate records crucial for legal defense

---

### Solutions & Best Practices

#### 1. **State Law Compliance Workflow**
```typescript
interface RecordingConsentSettings {
  state: string; // Agent's state
  consentType: 'one_party' | 'two_party' | 'all_party';

  consentWorkflow: {
    requireExplicitConsent: boolean; // Two-party states: TRUE
    consentMethod: 'verbal' | 'written' | 'digital_signature';
    consentRecorded: boolean; // Record the consent itself
  };

  clientNotification: {
    verbally: boolean; // "I'm recording this for my notes"
    visualIndicator: boolean; // Glasses LED light
    writtenDisclosure: boolean; // Sign at beginning of relationship
  };
}

// California (two-party consent)
const californiaAgent: RecordingConsentSettings = {
  state: 'CA',
  consentType: 'two_party',
  consentWorkflow: {
    requireExplicitConsent: true,
    consentMethod: 'verbal', // "Do you consent to being recorded?"
    consentRecorded: true // Record their "yes" response
  },
  clientNotification: {
    verbally: true, // Must tell client
    visualIndicator: true, // Glasses LED must be visible
    writtenDisclosure: true // Best practice: sign consent form
  }
};

// Texas (one-party consent)
const texasAgent: RecordingConsentSettings = {
  state: 'TX',
  consentType: 'one_party',
  consentWorkflow: {
    requireExplicitConsent: false, // Agent's consent is enough
    consentMethod: 'verbal', // Optional: still good practice to notify
    consentRecorded: false
  },
  clientNotification: {
    verbally: true, // Best practice: build trust
    visualIndicator: true,
    writtenDisclosure: false // Optional, but recommended
  }
};
```

#### 2. **Client Consent Scripts for Agents**
```
CALIFORNIA (Two-Party Consent - Required):
"Before we start, I want to let you know I use smart glasses to record our conversations.
This helps me remember your preferences and provide better service.
All recordings are confidential and only for my notes.
Do I have your consent to record our showing today?"

TEXAS (One-Party Consent - Best Practice):
"Just so you know, I use smart glasses to take notes during showings.
Everything is confidential and helps me remember what you're looking for.
Let me know if you have any questions about this."

COMMERCIAL (David - Institutional Clients):
"Our firm records client meetings for accuracy and compliance purposes.
All recordings are stored securely on our private servers and never shared externally.
This is covered in our engagement agreement section 4.2.
Any concerns before we begin?"
```

#### 3. **Visual/Audio Recording Indicators**
```
Ray-Ban Meta has LED indicator:
- White LED: Glasses are recording
- Off: Not recording

Requirements for real estate use:
1. LED must be visible to client
2. Agent verbally confirms recording at start
3. Agent can pause recording for sensitive topics
4. Recording auto-stops after 3 hours (failsafe)
```

#### 4. **Privacy Protection Features**
```typescript
interface RealEstatePrivacySettings {
  autoRedaction: {
    financialInfo: boolean; // Flag social security #, account numbers
    personalHealth: boolean; // HIPAA-protected info (disability, medical)
    protectedClasses: boolean; // Fair Housing (race, religion, family status)
  };

  sensitiveContentHandling: {
    blurFaces: boolean; // Privacy for other people in background
    muteAudioGaps: boolean; // Remove silence (captures less ambient conversation)
    localProcessingOnly: boolean; // David's NDA compliance
  };

  dataRetention: {
    autoDeleteAfter: number; // Days (30, 90, 365, never)
    deleteAfterTransaction: boolean; // Auto-delete after closing
    permanentArchive: boolean; // Keep for Fair Housing compliance (7 years)
  };
}
```

#### 5. **Fair Housing Compliance**
```typescript
// AI post-processing to flag Fair Housing risks
async function checkFairHousingCompliance(transcript: string): Promise<{
  compliant: boolean;
  warnings: string[];
}> {
  const warnings: string[] = [];

  // Check for protected class mentions
  const protectedClasses = [
    'race', 'color', 'national origin', 'religion',
    'sex', 'familial status', 'disability'
  ];

  for (const topic of protectedClasses) {
    if (transcript.toLowerCase().includes(topic)) {
      warnings.push(`⚠️ Transcript mentions "${topic}" - Fair Housing protected class. Review for compliance.`);
    }
  }

  // Check for discriminatory language
  const discriminatoryPhrases = [
    'family neighborhood', 'adults only', 'perfect for young couple',
    'church nearby', 'safe neighborhood' // (code for race)
  ];

  for (const phrase of discriminatoryPhrases) {
    if (transcript.toLowerCase().includes(phrase)) {
      warnings.push(`⚠️ Potential Fair Housing concern: "${phrase}". Consult compliance.`);
    }
  }

  return {
    compliant: warnings.length === 0,
    warnings
  };
}
```

## 💡 Recommendations for Transcript Parser

### Critical (Must Do - Sprint 03 or Q1 2025)

1. **Support Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses**
   - Largest market share among real estate professionals
   - Affordable ($299-$379 = 1 commission check)
   - Good recording quality (1080p, 5-mic spatial audio)
   - Simple cloud upload integration (MVP)

2. **Privacy-first design for real estate**
   - State law consent workflows (CA vs TX vs FL)
   - Client consent tracking
   - Fair Housing compliance checking
   - Local processing option (David persona - NDA compliance)

3. **Spatial audio transcription**
   - Tag transcript by room ("Living Room", "Kitchen", "Master Bedroom")
   - Huge value for property showings (Lisa, Michael)
   - Competitive advantage

---

### High Priority (Should Do - Post-Launch Phase 1)

4. **Apple Vision Pro support**
   - High-end market (commercial brokers like David, luxury agents)
   - Best spatial audio (6-mic array)
   - OCR capabilities (property specs, inspection reports)
   - Premium feature differentiation

5. **Direct device connection (privacy mode)**

## 🚀 Executive Summary & Recommendation

### The Future is XR for Real Estate
XR glasses will replace clipboards/phones for property documentation by 2026-2027. Agents will expect:
- Hands-free recording (no phone visible during showings)
- Real-time captions (AR overlay for bilingual agents like Carmen)
- Spatial audio (know which room had which comment)
- First-person POV (captures property details + client reactions)

### Transcript Parser Must Act Now
- **Q4 2024**: Research & plan XR integration
- **Q1 2025**: Basic support (Meta Ray-Ban) - Sprint 03 or post-launch MVP
- **Q2-Q3 2025**: Advanced features (spatial audio, direct connection, privacy mode)
- **2026**: Real-time AR captions (when Meta Orion launches)

### First-Mover Advantage
**No real estate tool currently supports XR glasses.**

If Transcript Parser launches XR support in Q1-Q2 2025, we become:
- **Default choice** for agents with XR glasses
- **Premium tier** justification ($12.99/mo vs $7.99/mo)
- **Press coverage** ("First AI real estate tool for AR glasses")
- **Brokerage partnerships** (CBRE, Keller Williams pilot programs)

**Recommendation**:
**Prioritize XR integration in roadmap. Start research in Sprint 03, launch support by Q2 2025 (before competitors).**
