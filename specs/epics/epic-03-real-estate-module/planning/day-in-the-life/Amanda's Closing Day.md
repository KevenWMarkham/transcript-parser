  - Sarah: "I'll accept $150. Can we document that?"

  - Sarah: "Yes." Mrs. Johnson: "Yes."

  - Sarah: "What if you don't complete it in 30 days?"
  - Tom (seller agent): "We can hold $800 in escrow. If fence is moved within 30 days, $800 goes to seller. If not completed, $800 goes to buyer for them to hire contractor."
  - Lisa: "Sarah, do you agree to that structure?"
  - Sarah: "Yes, that's fair."
  - Mr. Johnson: "We'll get it done within 30 days, no problem."

## 🎯 Implications for Design

### Must-Have Features for Title/Escrow Officers

1. **Local AI (Ollama) - MANDATORY** - Legal/financial data cannot go to cloud
2. **Multi-Speaker Identification** - Label who said what (6-8 people in closings)
3. **SoftPro Integration** - Export closing notes to title software
4. **Dollar Amount Extraction** - AI finds "$800 holdback," "$150 credit" in transcript
5. **Secure Transcript Sharing** - Send to all parties post-closing (encrypted)
6. **Search by Agreement Type** - "Show all fence agreements" or "appliance credits"
7. **Wire Instruction Verification** - Timestamp when wire instructions given
8. **Retention Policy** - Auto-archive after 7 years (state law compliance)

### User Flow Priorities

**Flow 1: Closing Meeting**
1. Setup → Start recording → Announce to parties (transparency)
2. Closing proceeds → Multi-speaker capture → Verbal agreements recorded
3. Finish → Review AI summary → Verify all agreements captured

**Flow 2: Post-Closing Distribution**
1. Export summary to SoftPro → One-click
2. Generate transcript excerpt → Share with all parties (encrypted email)
3. Archive full recording → 7-year retention

**Flow 3: Dispute Prevention**
1. Party claims: "That's not what we agreed!"
2. Search transcript: "Fence" or "Ice maker" or "$800"
3. Pull exact quote → Play for parties
4. Dispute resolved in minutes → $0 legal fees

### Metrics to Track

- **Primary**: Post-closing disputes (target: 0/year)
- **Secondary**: Legal fees (target: <$2K/year, down from $35K)
- **Tertiary**: Time per closing (target: <3.5 hrs)
- **Wire Fraud**: Incidents prevented (track verification requests)
- **Client Satisfaction**: Referrals from agents (target: >80%)

---

**Scenario Created**: December 21, 2024
**Last Updated**: December 21, 2024
**Key Takeaway**: Amanda's transformation from note-scribbling escrow officer to dispute-preventing documentation expert saves $94K/year and protects $680K from wire fraud. Multi-speaker identification is CRITICAL (6-8 people/closing). Local AI (Ollama) is MANDATORY for legal/financial confidentiality. Verbal side agreements (fence $800, ice maker $150) captured perfectly prevent $5K-$10K disputes. Speaker attribution ("Mrs. Johnson agreed to...") enables precise dispute resolution. Wire fraud prevention is career-saving - one $680K fraud blocked pays for system 200× over.
