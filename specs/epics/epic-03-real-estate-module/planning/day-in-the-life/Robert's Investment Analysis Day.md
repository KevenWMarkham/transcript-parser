- After walkthrough, tries to remember realtor's exact comp number: "Was it $260K or $280K?"
- Notebook notes: "Riverside Dr - needs work, maybe $35K reno, $260K ARV?"
- **Problem**: Vague notes, missed details, can't remember realtor's specific comps

**Evening (6:00 PM)**: Tries to analyze deal
- Opens DealCheck app to run numbers
- Purchase: $185K, Reno: $35K (guess), ARV: $260K (not sure)

- **Outcome**: Incomplete analysis, lacks confidence to make offer

#### With Transcript Parser ✅
- Robert starts recording before walkthrough: "1847 Riverside Drive, 3-bed 2-bath, $185K asking"
- Walks property, dictates observations naturally:
  - "Foundation: Diagonal crack on west exterior wall, approximately 3 feet long, appears cosmetic but need structural engineer confirmation before closing"
  - "Electrical: 100-amp panel, outdated, will need 200-amp service for rental code compliance, estimate $2,500-$3,500"
  - "Kitchen: Full gut required, cabinets are particle board 1970s, appliances non-functional, estimate $18K-$22K for mid-grade rental finish"
  - "Master bath: Water damage around tub, subfloor soft, needs full demo and rebuild, add $8K to budget"
- Realtor conversation captured:
  - Jennifer: "Recent comps: 1520 Riverside sold for $265K last month, 1702 Riverside sold for $258K two months ago. Both were similar size, full renovations. Market time was 14-18 days."
- Takes photos, knows verbal context is linked by timestamp

**After Walkthrough (in car, 5 min)**:
- Reviews AI summary:
  - Purchase Price: $185K
  - Renovation Estimate: $28.5K-$33.5K (kitchen $18-22K, bath $8K, electrical $2.5-3.5K)

  - Foundation: Needs engineer ($300-500 inspection)
- **Confidence**: Has exact numbers, exact comp data, ready to analyze

**Evening (6:00 PM)**: Deal analysis (20 min)
- Opens DealCheck, inputs data from transcript:
  - Purchase: $185K
  - Reno: $31K (midpoint of estimates)
  - ARV: $261K (conservative comp average)
  - Holding costs: 6 months
- Analysis shows 12% ROI - marginal deal
- Searches transcript: "foundation" - sees "structural engineer confirmation needed"
- Decision: Pass on deal unless engineer report shows foundation is cosmetic AND seller drops price to $175K
- **Outcome**: Fast, confident decision based on accurate data

#### With Transcript Parser + Advanced Features ⭐
- AI auto-extracts financial data:
  - Purchase Price: $185K

  - ARV: $261K (comp analysis from Jennifer's data)

- AI searches Robert's 20-year deal history: "foundation crack"
  - Finds 12 previous deals with foundation issues

  - Pattern: Diagonal cracks <4 ft usually cosmetic, >4 ft structural risk
- AI recommendation: "Foundation crack is 3 ft - likely cosmetic based on your historical data. Recommend structural engineer confirmation ($400). If cosmetic, adjust offer to $175K for 15% ROI margin."

**Property**: 3BR/1BA value-add flip, $165K asking, heavy reno
**Attending**: Robert + contractor Miguel (getting preliminary bid)

#### Without Transcript Parser ❌
- Robert and Miguel walk property
- Miguel: "This kitchen is going to need full demo, new cabinets, countertops, tile backsplash, probably $18K"
- Robert writes: "kitchen $18K"
- Miguel continues: "Bathroom is small, could expand into adjacent closet, add a second bathroom, increase value. That's $25K for full second bath addition."
- Robert writes: "2nd bath $25K"
- Miguel: "Electrical panel needs upgrade, foundation has settling, roof needs replacement in 2-3 years"
- Robert scribbling frantically, misses half the details
- After walkthrough: "Wait, did Miguel say $18K or $20K for kitchen? Did he include appliances?"
- Calls Miguel later: "Can you send me that bid in writing?" (Miguel: "That wasn't a formal bid, just rough estimates")
- **Problem**: Lost opportunity to capture detailed scope discussion

#### With Transcript Parser ✅
- Recording captures entire walkthrough + Miguel's commentary:
  - Miguel: "Kitchen full gut, demo existing cabinets and countertops. I'd quote $18,000 for mid-grade materials - shaker cabinets, quartz countertops, tile backsplash, new sink and faucet. Does NOT include appliances, add $2,500 for appliance package. Total kitchen: $20,500 all-in."
  - Miguel: "Bathroom is tight at 5x7 feet. You could steal 3 feet from adjacent bedroom closet, expand to 8x7, add second full bathroom. That's $25,000 - includes plumbing rough-in, tile work, vanity, toilet, shower. Big value add for resale."
  - Miguel: "Electrical panel is 100-amp, needs 200-amp upgrade for modern appliances and two bathrooms. $3,200 installed."
  - Miguel: "Foundation has minor settling in southeast corner, cosmetic cracks in drywall. I'd float the slab with mudjacking if it bothers you, $1,500. Not structural."
  - Miguel: "Roof has 2-3 years left, budget $9,000 for replacement if you're holding long-term. If flipping within 6 months, disclose to buyer but don't replace."

**After Walkthrough**:
- AI generates contractor bid summary:
  - Kitchen (with appliances): $20,500
  - Second bathroom addition: $25,000
  - Electrical upgrade: $3,200
  - Foundation (mudjacking): $1,500

- Robert writes: "$5,400 LVP"

- Robert writes: "$5,400 both"

  - James: "I quote $4.00 per square foot for LVP install, 1,200 sq ft is $4,800. That includes underlayment but NOT baseboards. Baseboards are additional $600 if you want them. Total $5,400 all-in. Timeline: 3 business days, I have crew available next week. 1-year labor warranty."
