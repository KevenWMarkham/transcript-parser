- Photo of a kitchen island - which property was that?
- Texts friend Emily: "I'm so confused. I can't remember which house had the open kitchen I loved."
- Emily: "Can you send me details? I want to help but I wasn't there."

- Tries to remember what she thought last time: "I liked the kitchen, right?"
- Takes more photos, same as last time

#### With Transcript Parser ✅
- Sarah reviews transcript from first showing (Week 4) before arriving
- Her exact words: "I LOVE this kitchen island - this is exactly what I've been looking for. But the backyard is smaller than I'd hoped - not sure if Buddy would have enough space."
- Remembers the trade-off clearly now
- During second showing, focuses on NEW questions:
  - "Could I expand the back patio for Buddy?"
  - "Is the kitchen island custom or standard?"
- Lisa searches her transcript archive: "Actually, you asked about the patio last time, and I said the HOA allows patio extensions up to 200 sq ft."
- Sarah: "Oh perfect! That solves the yard concern."
- Shares transcript + today's follow-up with Emily via text
- Emily reviews both transcripts: "If you can extend the patio, this works! I love that kitchen."
- **Outcome**: Productive second showing, Emily fully informed

#### With Transcript Parser + Advanced Features ⭐

- Emily adds comments in app: "Ask about HOA approval process for patio"
- Sarah sees Emily's question, asks Lisa immediately
- Lisa: "HOA approval takes 2-4 weeks, usually approved if under 200 sq ft"
- All captured in transcript, Emily sees the answer
- **Outcome**: Collaborative decision-making despite Emily not being present
