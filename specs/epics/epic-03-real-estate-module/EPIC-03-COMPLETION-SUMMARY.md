## 🎯 Critical Implementation Priorities

### MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH (From Expert Reviews)

#### 1. **State-by-State Recording Consent** (CRITICAL - Legal Liability)
- **Issue**: 12 states require two-party consent (criminal charges if violated)
- **Solution**: GPS-based consent warnings, suggested scripts, legal database
- **Cost**: $25K (legal research + database + quarterly updates)
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks (Sprint 01)
- **Risk**: Avoiding one lawsuit ($100K+) pays for 10 years of compliance

#### 2. **Local AI (Ollama) as Core Architecture** (CRITICAL - Privacy Compliance)
- **Issue**: Jennifer, Amanda, David cannot use cloud AI (PII/NDA violations)
- **Solution**: Ollama integration for zero-cloud processing
- **Cost**: Included in Sprint 01 architecture
- **Timeline**: Sprint 01
- **Impact**: 3x higher adoption for high-privacy personas

#### 3. **Fair Housing AI Detection** (CRITICAL - Regulatory Risk)
- **Issue**: Transcripts could capture discriminatory statements → $16K-$65K fines
- **Solution**: AI scans for protected class keywords, auto-redaction, warnings
- **Cost**: $30K (AI model training + legal review)
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks (Sprint 01/02)
- **Protection**: Prevents license loss + career-ending fines

#### 4. **Multi-Speaker Identification** (HIGH - Amanda's Requirement)
- **Issue**: 6-8 people in closings, "who said what?" is legally critical
- **Solution**: Pyannote Audio diarization + manual speaker labeling
- **Cost**: $40K (integration + UI)
- **Timeline**: Sprint 02
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ for 4-6 speakers, 75%+ for 7-8 speakers

#### 5. **Mobile Offline Mode** (HIGH - Field Operations)
- **Issue**: Many properties have no Wi-Fi/cell signal
- **Solution**: Record offline → sync when online
- **Cost**: Included in core architecture
- **Timeline**: Sprint 01
- **Battery**: <5% usage per hour

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Insights

### What Makes Epic-03 Different from Epic-09 (Student Module)?

1. **Privacy is NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Jennifer, David, Amanda REQUIRE local AI (vs. students where privacy is important but not mission-critical)

4. **Mobile-First is MANDATORY**: 85-90% mobile usage (vs. 40% for students)
5. **Multi-Party Complexity**: 6-8 people in closings (vs. 1-2 students)

### Why This Will Succeed

- **Real Pain**: Every persona has $70K-$300K annual ROI
- **Proven Demand**: NAR 1.5M members actively searching for transcription tools
- **Competitive Moat**: 18-month lead on local AI + compliance
- **Scalable**: SaaS model, low marginal cost, high LTV:CAC (42:1 to 117:1)
