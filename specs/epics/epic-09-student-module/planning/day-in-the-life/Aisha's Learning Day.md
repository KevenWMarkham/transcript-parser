## 🌅 Morning (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### 6:30 AM - Morning Routine & Commute
- **Context**: 1-hour commute from shared apartment to campus (bus + subway)
- **Mindset**: Nervous about presenting marketing case study today (in English, to native speakers)
- **Activity**: Reviews yesterday's lecture notes on phone during commute

- Feels anxious - probably missed important details

**With Transcript Parser**:

  - Main topic: Consumer decision-making process
  - Key terms: Cognitive dissonance, buyer's remorse, post-purchase behavior
  - Case example: Apple's ecosystem lock-in strategy
