**Persona**: Jordan Taylor - Student with Dyslexia
**Day**: Monday (reading-heavy history classes)
**Focus**: Overcoming reading challenges, leveraging auditory strengths, reducing cognitive load

---

## 🌅 Morning (7:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### 7:00 AM - Morning Routine
- **Context**: Monday = American History lecture + discussion section
- **Mindset**: Dreading today - professor assigned 60-page textbook reading over weekend
- **Reality**: Took 5 hours to read (vs. classmates' 90 minutes), mentally exhausted

**Current Challenge**:
- Required reading on "The Civil War Era, 1850-1877"
- Text is dense, small font, lots of dates and names
- Letters started swimming on page after hour 2
- Missed some details due to fatigue
- Feels unprepared despite spending all afternoon Sunday reading

### 8:00 AM - American History Lecture (90 min)
**Topic**: "Causes of the Civil War"

**Without Transcript Parser**:
- Brings laptop, tries to type notes
- Professor talks fast, shows slides with text
- Jordan reads slide, misses verbal explanation
- Tries to copy slide text, makes typos: "Missuri Compromise" (Missouri)
- Loses place in notes, can't keep up
- Gives up on typing, just listens (but will forget details)
- Leaves lecture stressed - knows notes are incomplete

**With Transcript Parser (Cloud AI)**:
- Opens app, starts recording
- Settings: Dyslexia-friendly mode (OpenDyslexic font, cream background, 16pt text)
- Tags: #History #CivilWar #LectureNotes
- Focuses entirely on listening (his strength!)
- Professor mentions "Bleeding Kansas" - Jordan remembers from reading but couldn't spell it
- Taps bookmark when professor explains Dred Scott case (wants to review later)
- Relaxed - knows transcript will have correct spelling, complete content

**With Transcript Parser + Meta Ray-Ban Glasses (Hands-Free)**:
- Wears Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses
- **Dyslexia benefit**: No typing, no reading during lecture - pure listening (his strength!)
- Starts recording with voice command (no buttons to press)
- **Hands-free note-taking**: Can sketch timelines, maps in notebook without managing devices
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Not juggling laptop/phone/notes simultaneously
- **Focus**: 100% attention on professor's verbal explanation (visual text is hard for him)
- After lecture: Has perfect transcript (all names spelled correctly) + his visual timeline sketches
- **Accessibility win**: Technology adapts to his learning style, not the other way around

### 9:45 AM - Between Classes (15 min)
**Without Transcript Parser**:
- Reviews laptop notes, sees typos and gaps
- Tries to Google "Missuri Compromise" - no results
- Realizes he misspelled, searches "Missouri Compromise"
- Frustrated, anxious about discussion section

**With Transcript Parser**:
- Opens app on phone
- Sees AI summary (90-second read):
  - Main causes: Slavery expansion, states' rights, economic differences
  - Key events: Missouri Compromise (1820), Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), Dred Scott (1857)

**Without Transcript Parser**:
- TA: "Let's discuss the assigned reading. What role did the Kansas-Nebraska Act play?"
- Jordan knows the answer (remembers from lecture + reading)
- Hesitates to speak (worried about mispronouncing "Kansas-Nebraska")
- Another student answers first
- Jordan stays quiet rest of class (wants to participate but nervous)
- Participation grade suffers

**With Transcript Parser**:
- Before class, uses text-to-speech to practice pronunciation:
  - "Kansas-Nebraska Act" ✓
  - "Dred Scott v. Sandford" ✓
  - "Bleeding Kansas" ✓
- In discussion:
  - TA asks about Kansas-Nebraska Act
  - Jordan raises hand: "The Kansas-Nebraska Act let territories decide slavery by popular sovereignty, which violated the Missouri Compromise and led to violence in Kansas..."
