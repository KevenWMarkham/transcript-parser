## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Lecture Recording & Review Workflow
1. **Before Lecture**:
   - Sits near front (easier to focus)
   - Opens Notability, starts audio recording
   - Has syllabus open (knows topic, reduces cognitive load)

2. **During Lecture**:
   - Focuses on listening (doesn't attempt detailed notes)
   - Types occasional keywords or timestamps
   - Takes photos of slides with phone (reads later with TTS)

3. **After Lecture** (same day):
   - Re-listens to recording while following typed keywords
   - Uses TTS to read any handouts or slides
   - Tries to create structured notes but often gives up (overwhelming)

4. **Before Exam** (1 week later):
   - Re-listens to key lectures (time-consuming)
   - Struggles to create study materials from messy notes
   - Relies heavily on textbook audiobooks

### With Transcript Parser - Ideal Workflow
1. **During Lecture**:
   - Focuses entirely on listening and understanding
   - No note-taking pressure

2. **After Lecture** (on laptop at home):
   - Opens transcript with dyslexia-friendly font
   - Uses text-to-speech to read along (multi-modal input)
   - AI-generated summary gives overview
   - Important terms are highlighted (visual cues)

3. **Study Preparation**:
   - Generates flashcards automatically (spelling is correct)
   - Gets structured outline (organized better than his notes)
   - Exports to Quizlet, uses with TTS
   - Quiz questions for self-testing

4. **Before Exam**:
   - Reviews summaries (faster than full transcripts)
   - Listens to audio while reading transcript (reinforcement)
   - Confident he hasn't missed key information

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In His Own Words

> "Reading is like running through mud for me. I can do it, but it takes so much energy. Audio is like running on a track - way easier."

> "I'm great at remembering what I hear, terrible at remembering what I read. Lectures are my strength."

> "When I try to take notes, I miss half the lecture because I'm thinking about spelling and where to write things. I can't do both at once."

> "Professors say 'just read the textbook,' but that takes me 6 hours for a chapter that classmates finish in 90 minutes. It's not fair."

> "I know I'm smart, but I feel stupid when I misread a date as 1956 instead of 1965 and get a test question wrong."

> "Text-to-speech is a game-changer, but most PDFs professors post aren't formatted right. The TTS reads everything out of order."

> "If I could get a clean transcript of every lecture, with proper formatting, I'd be a straight-A student. I understand the content when I hear it."
