- Records conference talks (10-15 at major conferences)
- Needs detailed notes with technical terms, equations, citations
- Wants to extract research ideas and track them over time

## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Research Challenges
1. **Information Density**
   - Seminars cover cutting-edge research (very complex)
   - Speakers present math-heavy content (equations, algorithms)
   - Can't listen actively while taking detailed notes
   - Misses nuances in Q&A discussions

2. **Note Organization**
   - Has notes scattered across: notebooks, iPad, laptop, voice memos
   - Hard to find specific ideas weeks later
   - Can't remember which seminar mentioned a particular technique
   - No way to link related ideas across different talks

3. **Citation Management**
   - Speakers mention papers but Marcus can't write down citations fast enough
   - Later can't remember: "Was that Smith et al. 2023 or 2024?"
   - Wastes time hunting down papers mentioned in seminars
   - Needs accurate citations for his own papers

4. **Collaboration Friction**
   - Lab meeting decisions get forgotten or misremembered
   - Teammates ask "What did we decide about X last week?"
   - No shared record of who's doing what
   - Ideas get lost in discussion, no follow-up

### Technology Pain Points
- Uses Otter.ai but transcripts are messy (technical terms wrong)
- Takes iPad notes but they're unstructured and hard to search
- Uses Zotero for papers but can't link to seminar notes
- No good way to tag "potential research directions" across sources

## 💻 Technical Profile

### Devices & Tools
- **Primary Device**: MacBook Pro 16" (coding, writing, research)
- **Secondary**: iPad Pro + Apple Pencil (equations, diagrams)
- **Phone**: iPhone (quick notes, audio recording at conferences)
- **Current Tools**:
  - Otter.ai (transcription - finds it inaccurate for technical content)
  - Notion (research wiki, project notes)
  - Zotero (reference manager, 500+ papers)
  - Obsidian (trying for knowledge graph, early adoption)
  - Overleaf (LaTeX for paper writing)
  - Slack (lab group communication)

### Tech Proficiency
- **Comfort Level**: Expert (CS PhD student)
- **Learning Style**: Reads documentation, experiments with APIs
- **Adoption**: Eager to try new tools if they integrate well
- **Customization**: Wants flexibility, scripts workflows
- **CLI-friendly**: Comfortable with command line, APIs

## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Research Seminar Workflow
1. **Before Seminar**: Creates new transcript with tags (speaker, topic, conference/internal)
2. **During Seminar**: Focuses on understanding, occasional iPad sketches of equations
3. **After Seminar** (same day):
   - Reviews transcript, corrects AI errors in technical terms
   - Adds annotations: "Related to my Chapter 3" or "Potential baseline method"
   - Extracts paper citations mentioned by speaker
   - Generates "Research Ideas" section with AI assistance
4. **During Writing** (weeks/months later):
   - Searches across all seminars for specific techniques
   - Finds where he first learned about an approach
   - Cites papers that were mentioned in seminar Q&A

### Lab Meeting Workflow
1. **Records entire 2-hour lab meeting**
2. **Extracts action items** - "Marcus: run baseline experiments by Friday"
3. **Generates summary** - Shares with advisor to confirm understanding
4. **Links to project notes** - Connects decisions to project documentation
5. **Creates reminders** - Tracks commitments and deadlines

### Conference Workflow
1. **Records 10-15 talks at NeurIPS/ICLR**
2. **Tags by topic** - Attention mechanisms, multi-modal learning, etc.
3. **Cross-references papers** - Links transcripts to arXiv PDFs in Zotero
4. **Identifies collaborators** - Notes interesting researchers to follow up with
5. **Exports insights** - Creates conference summary for lab group

## 📊 Success Metrics

### How Marcus Measures Success
- **Research productivity**: Faster literature review, more ideas generated
- **Citation accuracy**: Never loses a paper reference
- **Collaboration**: Lab group aligned on decisions
- **Time saved**: 3-5 hours/week on note organization
- **Idea capture**: No more "I remember someone talking about this but can't find my notes"

### What Would Make Him a Power User
- Technical term recognition (transformer, BERT, attention, backpropagation)
- Equation extraction (OCR from slides, formatted in LaTeX)
- Auto-citation extraction (hears "Smith et al. 2023", links to BibTeX)
- Graph view of connected concepts across seminars
- API access for custom integrations (Zotero, Overleaf)
- Collaboration features (shared lab meeting notes)

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In His Own Words

> "Seminars are where I get my best research ideas, but if I don't capture them in the moment, they're gone. My iPad notes are a mess."

> "Otter.ai is okay for business meetings, but it butchers technical content. It transcribes 'transformer architecture' as 'transfer architecture' and I have to fix everything."

> "I've spent hours looking for 'that paper someone mentioned in a seminar three months ago.' If I could search my transcript library, that would save so much time."

> "In lab meetings, we make important decisions, but there's no shared record. People remember things differently, and we waste time re-discussing."

> "I want my notes to be part of my research knowledge graph. If an app could connect seminar notes to papers in Zotero and my Obsidian vault, that's the dream."

> "Citation management is painful. I hear a citation in a talk, scribble it down wrong, then spend 15 minutes on Google Scholar trying to find the right paper."

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **Power user features** - Keyboard shortcuts, bulk operations
- **Technical accuracy** - Custom vocabulary for ML/NLP terms
- **Integration-first** - Export to Notion, Zotero, Obsidian, Markdown
- **Flexible organization** - Tags, folders, projects, graph view
- **API access** - Wants to script workflows

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Technical term accuracy** - Custom dictionaries for domains
2. **Citation extraction** - Auto-detect paper references
3. **Search across transcripts** - Fast, semantic search
4. **Export to research tools** - Markdown, BibTeX, Notion API
5. **Collaboration** - Shared lab meeting notes with comments
6. **Equation support** - LaTeX formatting for math
7. **Tagging & linking** - Connect related ideas across sources

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- Dumbed-down interfaces (he's technical, wants control)
- Proprietary formats (needs open data, exportability)
- No API (wants automation, custom workflows)
- Limited customization (every researcher works differently)
- Inaccurate transcription of technical content (deal-breaker)

- **Equation recognition**: Capture LaTeX or image snapshots of math
- **Code snippets**: Detect when speaker shares pseudocode or algorithms
- **Graph structures**: Visualize concept relationships over time
- **Version control**: Track how ideas evolve across meetings

### Integration Needs
- **Zotero**: Link transcripts to papers, export citations
- **Notion**: Sync notes to research wiki
- **Obsidian**: Export Markdown with internal links
