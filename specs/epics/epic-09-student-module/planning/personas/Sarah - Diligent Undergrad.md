## 👤 Basic Information

**Name**: Sarah Chen
**Age**: 20
**Location**: Boston, MA
**Education**: Junior, Biology Major (Pre-Med track)
**University**: Medium-sized state university
**GPA Goal**: 3.8+ (for med school applications)

---

## 🎯 Goals & Motivations

### Academic Goals
- **Get into medical school** - Top priority, drives all study decisions
- **Maintain high GPA** - Especially in science courses (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
- **Master complex concepts** - Not just memorize, but truly understand
- **Efficient studying** - Balance academics with part-time job and extracurriculars

### Personal Goals
- Have time for campus activities (pre-med club, volunteering)
- Maintain social life and mental health
- Save time by studying smarter, not just harder
- Build strong foundation for MCAT and medical career

### Why She Needs Transcript Parser
- Records 4-6 lectures per week (Biology, Organic Chemistry, Physics)
- Struggles to take notes fast enough during complex lectures
- Wants to review difficult sections multiple times
- Needs to create study materials for exams (flashcards, practice questions)
- Limited time due to part-time job at campus library (15 hrs/week)

## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Study Challenges
1. **Information Overload**
   - Professors cover too much material too quickly
   - Hard to identify what's "important" for exams
   - Gets lost in details, misses big picture

2. **Note-Taking Struggles**
   - Can't write fast enough during lectures
   - Misses explanations while copying diagrams
   - Notes are messy and hard to review later

3. **Exam Preparation Time**
   - Creating flashcards manually takes 2-3 hours per lecture
   - Re-watching entire recorded lectures is time-consuming
   - Can't find specific topics quickly in 90-minute recordings

4. **Study Inefficiency**
   - Doesn't know which concepts she understands vs. needs more work
   - Wastes time re-studying material she already knows
   - Procrastinates because exam prep feels overwhelming

### Technology Pain Points
- Uses basic phone recorder app (no transcript, just audio)
- Relies on handwritten notes (hard to search, often incomplete)
- Manually creates Quizlet flashcards (very time-consuming)
- No way to track which topics she's mastered

## 💻 Technical Profile

### Devices & Tools
- **Primary Device**: MacBook Air (for studying and writing)
- **Secondary**: iPhone 13 (records lectures, studies on-the-go)
- **Current Tools**:
  - Voice Memos app (lecture recording)
  - Apple Notes (class notes)
  - Quizlet (flashcards - 30-50 cards per exam)
  - Notion (class organization, to-do lists)
  - Anki (trying to use for spaced repetition, finds it complex)

### Tech Proficiency
- **Comfort Level**: Intermediate
- **Learning Style**: Prefers simple, intuitive interfaces
- **Adoption**: Quick to adopt tools that save time
- **Mobile**: Studies 40% on phone (commute, between classes)

## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Weekly Lecture Recording Workflow
1. **Before Lecture**: Opens Transcript Parser, starts new recording with course tag
2. **During Lecture**: Focuses on listening, lets app record + transcribe
3. **After Lecture** (within 24 hours):
   - Reviews AI-generated summary (5 min vs. 90 min re-watch)
   - Highlights key definitions and concepts
   - Generates flashcards for terminology
4. **Before Exam** (1-2 weeks later):
   - Uses search to find specific topics across all lectures
   - Reviews quiz questions generated from transcripts
   - Exports flashcards to Anki for spaced repetition

### Specific Scenarios
- **Missed class**: Gets transcript from classmate, generates own study guide
- **Lab lecture**: Records complex procedure explanation, re-watches specific steps
- **Office hours**: Records TA explaining difficult concept, creates notes
- **Study group**: Shares annotated transcript with study partners

## 📊 Success Metrics

### How Sarah Measures Success
- **Time saved**: Wants to reduce exam prep time by 50%
- **Grade improvement**: Maintain A/A- in science courses
- **Confidence**: Feels prepared going into exams, less anxiety
- **Free time**: Gains 5-10 hours/week for other activities

### What Would Make Her a Power User
- Flashcards generated automatically match exam questions
- Can create complete study guide in < 30 minutes
- Search finds concepts across entire semester of lectures
- Mobile app lets her study during commute (30 min each way)
- Tracks progress so she knows what to focus on

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Her Own Words

> "I'm a visual learner, but my Bio professor talks so fast I can't even draw the diagrams he's explaining. I end up missing both the picture AND the explanation."

> "Making flashcards takes forever, but I know they work. If an app could do that automatically, I'd pay for it."

> "I've recorded lectures before, but re-watching 90 minutes to find one 5-minute explanation is ridiculous. I need timestamps or something."

> "Anki is powerful but SO confusing. I just want simple flashcards that remind me to review before I forget."

> "Half the battle is figuring out what's actually going to be on the exam. If AI could tell me 'these are the most important concepts,' that would be huge."

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **Simple, clean interfaces** - No clutter, focus on content
- **Quick access to key features** - Flashcards, summaries, search
- **Visual hierarchy** - Important concepts highlighted
- **Mobile-optimized** - Big touch targets, readable text
- **Progress indicators** - Show what's complete, what needs work

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Auto-generated flashcards** - Saves most time
2. **Lecture summaries** - Quickly review key points
3. **Search across lectures** - Find topics instantly
4. **Quiz generation** - Self-testing for retention
5. **Study guide export** - PDF for printing/annotating
6. **Spaced repetition reminders** - Better than Anki, easier to use

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- Complex setup processes (wants 1-click start)
- Too many customization options (analysis paralysis)
- Jargon or academic language in UI
- Requiring desktop app (needs mobile flexibility)
- Manual tagging/categorization (should be automatic)
