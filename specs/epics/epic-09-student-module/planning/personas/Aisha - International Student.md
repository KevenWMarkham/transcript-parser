## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Her Own Words

> "I understand English, but in lectures professors speak so fast, and I'm translating in my head. By the time I understand, they've moved on."

> "Sometimes everyone laughs at something the professor said, and I have no idea why. I feel like I'm missing half the lesson."

> "I record every lecture and listen again at home. It takes so long, but I'm afraid I'll miss something important for the exam."

> "When I read a transcript, I can go at my own pace. I can stop and think, 'Okay, what does this mean?' With audio, it just keeps going."

> "I wish someone could tell me, 'These are the 10 most important things from today's lecture.' I don't know what's important and what's just extra explanation."

> "Making flashcards helps me learn, but it takes forever. If I could get flashcards automatically, I'd actually use them more."

> "Sometimes I need to explain a concept to myself in Bengali first, then I can understand it in English."

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **Simple, clear language** - Avoid jargon in UI/instructions
- **Visual learning aids** - Icons, color coding, highlighting
- **Reading-first design** - Transcripts more important than audio
- **Translation integration** - Seamless word/phrase lookup
- **Mobile-optimized** - Studies primarily on phone/tablet
- **Offline mode** - Spotty internet in some study locations

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Accurate transcription** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Translation integration** - Built-in dictionary/translation
3. **Simplified summaries** - Clearer English for non-native speakers
4. **Key concept highlighting** - Shows what's important
5. **Bilingual flashcards** - English term + definition in native language
6. **Cultural context notes** - Explains references/idioms
7. **Slow-down playback** - 0.75x or 0.5x speed option

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Text size controls** - Needs larger text on phone
- **High contrast mode** - Easier reading in bright library
- **Simple navigation** - Fewer clicks to key features
- **Error forgiveness** - Clear undo, helpful error messages
- **Help documentation** - Video tutorials, not just text

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- Complex English in UI (use simple, clear words)
- Assuming cultural knowledge (explain idioms, references)
- Audio-only features (she needs text)
- No offline mode (internet unreliable)
- Expensive pricing (student budget, international tuition already high)
