## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Morning Walking Tour Workflow
1. **Before Tour (8:00 AM)**:
   - Wants to record tour guide without phone in hand
   - Needs GPS to auto-tag locations visited

2. **During Tour (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**:
   - Tour guide shares historical stories, restaurant tips, hidden gems
   - Other tourists swap recommendations
   - Local vendor teaches her phrase for bargaining

3. **After Tour (12:30 PM)**:
   - Wants transcript of guide's stories for blog
   - Needs list of all restaurants mentioned with locations
   - Review vocabulary learned in context

4. **Evening (8:00 PM)**:
   - Writing blog post, needs to recall specific anecdote guide told
   - Planning tomorrow, wants to visit restaurant guide recommended

### Hostel Common Room Scenario
- Sitting with 6 travelers swapping tips for next destinations
- Everyone recommends different cities, hostels, experiences
- Currently: frantically typing notes, asking people to repeat
- **Ideal**: Record conversation, extract recommendations by city later

### Language Exchange with Local
- Meeting local friend for coffee to practice Thai
- Friend teaches 20+ phrases and corrections
- Currently: writes phonetic spelling, loses nuance
- **Ideal**: Audio + transcript with corrections highlighted

### Budget Street Food Discovery
- Local shows her where locals actually eat (not tourist areas)
- Gets dish names, stall locations, "secret menu" items
- Currently: takes photos, hopes to remember
- **Ideal**: Transcript with GPS pins + photos linked to conversation

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Their Own Words

> "I have voice memos of amazing conversations with locals, but they just sit there. I never have time to listen to 2 hours of audio to find that one restaurant name."

> "My Notion is supposed to be my travel brain, but I'm always 2 weeks behind. By the time I write about Bangkok, I'm already in Vietnam and can't remember the details."

> "Locals teach me phrases, but without the audio I can't remember how to pronounce them. Duolingo doesn't teach 'Hey, your tuk-tuk is ripping me off' in Thai."

> "I get so many good recommendations in hostel common rooms. But when six people are talking at once about different cities, I can only catch half of it."

> "I want to write authentic travel stories, not generic 'I visited a temple' posts. But I forget the exact story the guide told about why it was built."

> "My biggest travel anxiety isn't getting lost—it's forgetting all the amazing things people tell me."

> "I'd pay good money for an app that listens to my day and tells me 'Here are the 12 places mentioned, 8 Thai phrases you learned, and 3 budget tips to remember.'"

## 🎨 Design Implications

### UI/UX Preferences
- **Mobile-First**: 95% of usage on phone, one-handed operation essential
- **Quick Capture**: Big red "Record" button, minimal setup
- **Offline-First**: Must work without WiFi, sync when connected
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Map pins > Lists > Long transcripts
- **Dark Mode**: Often reviews notes in dark hostel rooms
- **Low Data**: Minimize background data usage
- **Battery Conscious**: All-day recording shouldn't kill phone

### Feature Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Auto-transcription with language detection** (Thai/Spanish/English mixed)
2. **Recommendation extraction** (restaurants, hostels, activities) with GPS
3. **Language flashcard export** to Anki with audio clips
4. **Map view** of all mentioned places
5. **Offline recording** with background upload when on WiFi
6. **Daily summary** of tips, phrases, places learned
7. **Budget tracking** (auto-detect price mentions)
8. **Instagram integration** (turn transcript excerpts into captions)
9. **Share lists** ("Emma's Bangkok Recommendations") with other travelers
10. **Smart search**: "Show me all street food tips in Chiang Mai"

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- **Heavy Manual Tagging**: No time to categorize during recording
- **Desktop-First Design**: Rarely has laptop access
- **WiFi Dependency**: Can't require connection for core features
- **Storage Hogs**: Phone is always near capacity
- **Slow Transcription**: Needs results within hours, not days
- **Privacy Invasion**: Don't auto-share anything without permission
- **Complex Setup**: Should work in 30 seconds for spontaneous moments
- **Battery Drain**: Can't make phone unusable by afternoon
