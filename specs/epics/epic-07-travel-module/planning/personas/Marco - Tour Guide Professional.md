## 🎯 Goals & Motivations

### Primary Goals
- Deliver exceptional, personalized experiences that earn 5-star reviews
- Build database of client preferences and feedback for repeat business
- Train new guides with consistent quality and storytelling techniques
- Capture and remember guest questions to improve future tours
- Track which stories/jokes resonate most with different demographics
- Streamline administrative work (reviews, recommendations, follow-up)
- Scale business without losing personal touch

### Why He Needs Transcript Parser
- **Quality Control**: Can't remember all guest feedback during end-of-tour conversations
- **Training Tool**: Wants to record his best tours to train new guides
- **Client Relationships**: Guests ask for recommendations, he forgets to send them
- **Content Creation**: Wants to create audio guides but doesn't have time to write scripts
- **Performance Analytics**: Which stories work? Which fall flat? He doesn't have data
- **Liability Protection**: Occasionally needs records of what was said (allergy info, meeting places)
- **Review Management**: Guests promise to leave reviews but forget specifics to mention

---

## 😓 Pain Points & Frustrations

### Current Challenges

1. **Recommendation Overload**
   - Each guest asks: "Where should we eat tonight? Best beer garden? Local jazz club?"
   - Gives 20+ recommendations per 3-hour tour
   - Promises to "send you my list" → Never does (too busy)
   - Guests email later: "What was that restaurant near Charles Bridge you mentioned?"
   - **Lost Revenue**: Could earn affiliate/referral income, never follows up
   - **Review Impact**: "Great tour but never sent the restaurant list" = 4-star instead of 5

2. **Training New Guides**
   - Hiring seasonal guides, needs to transfer 18 years of knowledge
   - Writes training manual (40 pages) → New guides don't read it
   - Shadow tours are expensive (pays guide to not earn money)
   - New guides forget key stories, miss great jokes, skip important safety info
   - **Quality Inconsistency**: Clients book "Marco's tour," get junior guide, disappointed
   - **Time Sink**: Spends 20 hours training each guide every season

3. **Guest Feedback Loss**
   - End-of-tour conversations reveal valuable insights
   - Guest: "I wish you'd spent more time on the Cold War history"
   - Another guest: "The Jewish Quarter section was too long for our kids"
   - Makes mental notes to adjust → Forgets by next tour
   - **Quality Stagnation**: Not improving based on actual feedback
   - **Missed Opportunities**: Could create family-friendly version, never does

4. **Content Creation Paralysis**
   - Wants to create self-guided audio tour (passive income during off-season)
   - Sitting down to write script is overwhelming
   - Already tells stories brilliantly in person, can't translate to written form
   - **Lost Revenue**: Could sell audio tours at €10 each, has sold 0

5. **Administrative Burden**
   - After 5-hour tour day, needs to:
     - Send promised restaurant lists to 8 guests
     - Follow up with private tour inquiry email
     - Update TripAdvisor with new city details
     - Create custom itinerary for tomorrow's private group
   - Currently: Does 30% of it, rest falls through cracks
   - **Review Scores**: "Promised recommendations, never got them" appears in 15% of reviews
   - **Lost Bookings**: Slow response to private tour inquiries = client books competitor

6. **Performance Uncertainty**
   - Tells 20 stories per tour, doesn't know which ones actually work
   - Some jokes land, some don't—but with different tour groups, he can't tell patterns
   - Questions guests ask repeatedly → Should proactively address in tour script
   - **Wasted Time**: Spends 5 minutes on story nobody cares about, rushes story they love

7. **Language Barrier Documentation**
   - International clients have varying English levels
   - Sometimes realizes mid-tour that guest didn't understand key safety info
   - Wants to offer tours in German but doesn't have German scripts
   - **Safety Risk**: Guest with food allergy might not fully understand warning
   - **Market Limitation**: Could serve German-speaking market better with translated content

### Technology Pain Points
- Current stack: TripAdvisor (listings), Google Calendar (bookings), WhatsApp (client communication), Notes app (scattered recommendations), Dropbox (training manual nobody reads)
- **Fragmentation**: Client info across email, WhatsApp, booking platforms
- **No CRM**: Can't track repeat clients, their preferences, past conversations
- **Manual Everything**: Every recommendation list typed out individually
- **No Analytics**: Flying blind on what works vs. what doesn't

---

## 💻 Technical Profile

### Devices & Tools
- **Primary**: Samsung Galaxy S22 (Android user)
- **Secondary**: iPad 10.2" (for booking management at home)
- **Laptop**: Old Windows laptop (rarely used, slow)

### Tech Proficiency

- **Learning Style**: Needs immediate practical value to invest time learning
- **Pain Threshold**: Will tolerate inefficiency if new tool is too complex

## 🎓 Typical Use Cases

### Morning Historical Walking Tour (3 hours, 12 guests)

1. **During Tour**:
   - Tells 15 stories about Prague history
   - Makes 8 restaurant recommendations throughout
   - Guests ask 20 questions (some repeats: "Is Prague Castle the biggest in world?")
   - Tells joke about Czech beer culture → Big laughs (works!)
   - Guest with gluten allergy asks about safe restaurant options
   - End of tour: Guests ask for jazz club, vegetarian restaurant, currency exchange tips

2. **Currently After Tour**:
   - Rushed 15-minute break before next tour
   - Promises to email restaurant list → Forgets
   - Made mental note: "Spend less time on Wenceslas Square history, they seemed bored"
   - Forgets mental note by next tour
   - Guest with gluten allergy emails later: "What were those restaurants?" → Can't remember which ones were safe

3. **With Transcript Parser**:
   - Auto-transcription captures entire tour
   - Extracts all 8 restaurant recommendations with context (gluten-free flagged)
   - One-click share: "Marco's Recommendations from Your Tour" sent to all guests
   - Analytics: "Joke about beer at minute 47 → highest engagement score"
   - Question tracking: "Prague Castle size asked 3 times → Add to standard script"
   - Safety documentation: Gluten-free restaurant list auto-saved with guest contact

### Evening Private Food Tour (2.5 hours, family of 4)

- More intimate, conversational format
- Family shares preferences: "We love craft beer," "Daughter is vegetarian"
- Marco tailors recommendations on the fly
- Great conversation about Czech food culture, family promises 5-star review
- Currently: Remembers they loved craft beer, forgets to send follow-up with brewery list
- **Ideal**: Captures preferences, auto-generates personalized follow-up email

### Training New Guide (Sarah, First Week)

- Sarah shadows Marco on tour
- Tries to take notes while walking, misses half the stories
- Marco: "The key is telling the story about Jan Hus with emotion, not just facts"
- Sarah's notes: "Jan Hus - emotion important" (not helpful)
- Currently: Sarah wings it on her first solo tour, quality is inconsistent
- **Ideal**: Sarah gets transcripts of Marco's best tours, studies exact phrasing, timing, storytelling structure

### Monthly Performance Review (Self-Improvement)

- Marco wants to improve but doesn't know what to change
- Questions: "Am I spending too much time on Cold War history? Do people enjoy the Kafka section?"
- Currently: No data, goes with gut feeling
- **Ideal**: Analytics dashboard:
  - "Cold War section: 18 minutes average, 6.5/10 engagement"
  - "Kafka section: 12 minutes average, 9/10 engagement"
  - "Most asked questions: Prague Castle size (15x), Currency tips (12x), Beer recommendations (45x)"
  - Recommendation: Shorten Cold War, expand Kafka, proactively address FAQ questions

### Creating Audio Guide (Winter Passion Project)

- Winter is slow season (Nov-March)
- Wants to create €10 self-guided audio tour for passive income
- Sitting at laptop trying to "write" tour is painful
- Currently: 3 years of "I should do this," 0% progress
- **Ideal**: Select 5 best tour recordings, AI generates cohesive script, Marco edits/refines, records final version

### Guest Follow-Up & Relationship Management

- Guest emails 2 weeks later: "We're back in Prague with friends, want private tour!"
- Marco doesn't remember them specifically (does 200+ tours/year)
- Searches email: "Ah yes, the couple from Toronto who loved beer gardens"
- Wishes he could remember: What did we talk about? What were they interested in?
- **Ideal**: CRM-style view: "Toronto couple, June 15 tour, asked about craft beer (mentioned 5 breweries), loved Cold War history, want family-friendly option for friends"

## 💬 Quotes & Insights

### In Their Own Words

> "I tell people about 8 great restaurants on every tour. I promise to send the list. I send it maybe 30% of the time. The other 70% forget, and that's why I get 4 stars instead of 5."

> "I've been doing this for 18 years. I should know exactly which stories work and which don't. But I'm still guessing. I need data."

> "Training new guides is painful. I can't be on every tour. I need them to learn from my best performances, but I can't clone myself."

> "Guests ask the same questions every tour: 'Is Prague Castle really the biggest?' I should just add it to my script. But I forget to add it, then someone asks again next week."

> "I want to make an audio guide. I tell these stories every day—they're already written in my head! But sitting down to type them out? Never happens."

> "A couple came on my tour in June. They emailed in October: 'We're back with friends, want a private tour!' I have no idea what they liked. I'm starting from zero when I could be building on our relationship."

> "When guests have food allergies, I recommend safe places. But if they email me later, I can't always remember which restaurants I specifically told THEM. That's a safety issue."

> "My competitors use generic scripts from training companies. I have 18 years of stories and local knowledge in my head. If I could turn that into training materials, I'd have the best guide team in Prague."

> "Winter is dead. I make €500/month November through March. If I could sell audio guides for €10 each, even 300 sales would transform my winter income. But creating them feels impossible."

- Complex analytics (needs simple dashboards, not data science)

**Business Misalignment**:
- Consumer-focused design (this is a business tool)

- Lack of CRM features (repeat clients are 15% of revenue)

**Platform Limitations**:
- iOS-only (uses Android)
- Cloud-dependent (needs offline for tours)
- No export options (wants data ownership)
- Subscription only (seasonal business, prefers annual payment)

**Tour Guide Workflow**:
- Requires phone in hand (needs pocket recording)
- Interrupts tour flow (can't be fidgeting with app)
- Battery drain (8-hour tour days)
- Storage hog (limited phone space)

**Privacy & Legal**:
- No consent management (recording clients requires disclosure)
- Can't delete sensitive data (GDPR compliance)
- No data retention controls (how long to keep tour recordings?)
