## 🚀 How to Run This Orchestration

### Option 1: Single Claude Session

Copy this entire file and paste it into a new Claude conversation with the prompt:

```
I am conducting a sprint planning session for a monorepo transformation project.
Please execute the orchestration workflow described in this document, embodying
all 7 expert personas and producing all required deliverables.

Project context is in the attached files:
- Sprint 01 - Overview.md
- Epic 01 - Overview.md
- ROADMAP.md

Please start with Phase 1: Context Review.
```

### Option 2: Guided Session

Work through each phase sequentially, asking Claude to:
1. "Please review the sprint context and provide a summary (Phase 1)"
2. "Now embody the Architecture Expert and provide feedback (Phase 2.1)"
3. "Now embody the UX Expert and create wireframes (Phase 2.2)"
4. ... continue through all phases

### Option 3: Parallel Sessions

Run multiple Claude sessions in parallel, each handling one expert persona:
- Session 1: Architecture Expert
- Session 2: UX Expert
- Session 3: Performance Expert
- etc.

Then consolidate feedback in a final session.

---

## 🎓 Pro Tips for Effective Orchestration

### For Claude (AI Assistant)
- **Be specific**: Don't just say "good job" - provide detailed, actionable feedback
- **Be critical**: Identify real risks and concerns, don't just rubber-stamp the plan
- **Be creative**: Suggest innovative solutions the team might not have considered
- **Be consistent**: Each expert should maintain their persona and expertise
- **Be thorough**: Cover all aspects of their domain

### For Human Facilitator
- **Read all outputs**: Review every expert feedback document
- **Challenge assumptions**: Ask "what if" questions
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Not all recommendations can be implemented
- **Document decisions**: Write down why you chose one approach over another
- **Iterate**: This process should improve with each sprint
